To create the philosophy_phrases models run:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    python manage.py makemigrations philosophy_phrases\r\n    python manage.py migrate\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Then you have to use one of the functions in your view like this:\r\n\r\n    a) function get_phrase() will return a dictionary consist phrase and its author.\r\n    ```python\r\n    from philosophy_phrases.phrase import get_phrase\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    def Your_view_name(request):\r\n        phrase = get_phrase()\r\n\t...\r\n    ```\r\n    and then insert it into your template:\r\n    ```python\r\n    {{ phrase.phrase }}\r\n    {{ phrase.author }}\r\n    ```\r\n    b) function get_phrase_in_popup() will return html code for popup.\r\n    ```python\r\n    from philosophy_phrases.phrase import get_phrase_in_popup()\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    def Your_view_name(request):\r\n        phrase = get_phrase_in_popup()\r\n\t...\r\n    ```\r\n    and then insert it into your template (you have to use filter 'safe' for correct displaying html and js in your template):\r\n    ```\r\n    {{ phrase|safe }}\r\n    ```\r\n5. If there is no any phrase in your db, functions get_phrase_in_popup() and get_phrase() will return an empty string.\r\n6.
